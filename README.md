# How to Retain Customers and Influence People
**Author:** Alexis Deviney

## Overview
<mark>The</mark> goal of this project is to recommend strategies to minimize customer churn (or service termination) from a fictional telecommunications company. In my analysis, I answered the following questions:
1. What customer demographics have the highest proportion of customer churn?
2. Is service/product engagement a predictor of churn? Which products, when opted into, confer a lower probability of a customer to churn?
3. What services are the most profitable?
4. What is the tenure of customers who decide to churn? Are new or old customers churning?
6. Are longer contracts conductive to customer retention?

## Business Problem
* Attracting new customers can be up to 5x more costly than retaining existing customers. 
* Predict and prevent churn to retain customers at Telco telecommunications company. 
  * Analyze all relevant data to determine which customers are likely to churn.
  * Help develop focused customer retention programs. 

## Data
I analyzed a data consisting of information on 7,043 unique customers and information relating to their demographics, account history, and services.

### Data Sources
Cognos Analytics Sample Datasets
* [Customer Churn](https://community.ibm.com/accelerators/catalog/content/Customer-churn)
* [Telco Customer Churn](https://community.ibm.com/accelerators/catalog/content/Telco-customer-churn)
* [Telco Customer Churn Status and Reason for Leaving](https://community.ibm.com/accelerators/catalog/content/Telco-customer-churn-status-and-reason-for-leaving)

## Methods

**Data Prepartion and EDA (Spell out what EDA stands for here)**

See [my data preparation Jupyter Notebook](./EDA.ipynb) for detailed steps I took to obtain, clean and visually analyze the data. The general steps were:
1. Reviewed contents of the files provided, and decided which features were unique across all files and relevant to retain in my final combined dataset.
2. Imported raw data into dataframes, did some basic formatting, and visualized distributions of univarate features. 
3. Created visualizations to explore most common reasons for churn.
4. Used hypothesis testing to create a function to indicate statistically significant churn reasons for a given demographic or service group. (Despite my hopes, this did not garner deeper insights.)
5. Created visualizations to explore churn percentages of different demographic, service, and account groups.
6. Created visualizations to explore the monthly charges of package groups, separted by contract type.
7. Created visualizations to explore churn rate across contract type and tenure.

**Technical Presentation about Initial EDA**

In the following presentation, I discuss my progress in EDA to this point and plans for machine learning development. Please note that at this point, I had not yet found the additional datasets I have incorporated into the final version of my project. This in-progress presentation also excludes the more refined and detailed visuals I had created for my final presentation. Quite honestly I will probably re-do this video from the current version because I have a lot more to discuss now. But here it is in its crude form

**Machine Learning Model Development**

See [my ML Jupyter Notebook](./ModelDevelopment.ipynb) for detailed steps I took to develop and evaluate machine learning models. Due to class imbalances, I tested each model with additions of SMOTE to oversample the minority class and the True class_balanced parameter when available. The metric results of each model I tested are available below:

I chose two production models - Logistic Regression with SMOTE (hereby Model #1) and Logistic Regression (hereby Model #2) because they had the highest recall and precision on the minority class, respectively. Model #1 would be good to implement for low-cost general approaches where it would be important to identify *all* customers at risk of churning. Model #2 would be useful for situations where the accuracy of the to-churn customers would be important, such as offering proactive discounts or more aggressive outreach.

## Final Executive Presentation
You can watch the 5-minute presentation of my final analysis, production models, and recommendations to stakeholders (i.e. my class) [here](https://youtu.be/02OBC89z_4w?t=1530).

## Suggestions for Further Analysis
- [ ] Incorporate the customer lifetime value (CLTV) metric provided in the "Telco_customer_churn.xlsx" dataset to develop a profit-oriented retention outreach, targeting high-value customers
- [ ] Use K-means clustering to identify different groups of customers, which may help to personalize outreach / retention strategies to specific needs. This could be helpful for automating outreach, which will reduce labor costs
- [ ] Develop and test a deep learning (NN) model in an effort to improve model performance
